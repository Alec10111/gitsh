# Gitsh
gitsh is a repo that will contain scripts to help automate git work
To start off I have the igit.sh script that creates a repo locally and on the remote

## Setup
In order to run this you have to give access to the script to be executed on your machine (One time step)
```console
chmod 755 igit.sh
```
Also you need github cli. On mac you can use brew, and for different OS you can check official documentation in [https://cli.github.com/]

```console
brew install gh
```

Now you have to generate a token on your github account to authorise your device to access the repos **to do**
